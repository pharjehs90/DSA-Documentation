# DSA-Documentation
Embarking on data analysis marks a significant milestone in my journey to becoming a skilled Data Analyst. I have been building my skills in Excel, pivot tables, data visualization, and dashboard design. My DSA experience will help me to practically apply these skills to a real-world business scenario, analyzing customer review data to drive decision making.
